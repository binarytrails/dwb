NAME
----
dwbem - dwb extension manager

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dwbem* ['OPTIONS'] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*dwbem* is a command line tool that handles extensions for dwb.

OPTIONS
-------
*-a*::
*--list-all*:: 
  List all available extensions that can be handled by dwbem.
 
*-b*::
*--bind*::
  When used together with *-i* the extension will be loaded with 'extensions.bind'
  instead of extensions.load, i.e. it is possible to bind a shortcut for
  enabling/disabling the extension on the fly.

*-B* 'extension':: 
*--setbind* 'extension'::
  Edit configuration of 'extension', the extension will be loaded with 'extensions.bind', 
  i.e. it is possible to bind a shortcut for enabling/disabling
  the extension on the fly, see also -L.

*-d* 'extension'::
*--disable* 'extension'::
  Disable 'extension', the extension will still be installed and the
  configuration will be kept.

*-e* 'extension'::
*--enable* 'extension'::
  Enable an extension that was previously disabled with *-d*.

*-i* 'extension'::
*--install* 'extension'::
  Install 'extension'. If it is a local extension that was installed together
  with dwb the extension will not be downloaded, only the default configuration
  will  be set. Note that reinstalling an already installed extension will
  overwrite the configuration with the default configuration.

*-I* 'extension':: 
*--info* 'extension'::
  Show information about 'extension'.

*-l*:: 
*--list*::
  List installed extensions handled by dwbem.

*-L* 'extension':: 
*--setload* 'extension'::
  Edit configuration for 'extension'. The extension will be loaded with
  'extensions.load', see also *-B*.

*-n*::
*--no-config*:: 
  Don't use a configuration in the loader script, use
  '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dwb/extensionrc' instead. The extension will simply be
  loaded with 'extensions.load("extension");'. This option can be combined with *-i*,
  *-B* or *-L*. If combined with *-i* it will be applied to all installed
  extensions.

*-N*::
*--no-confirm*:: 
  Can be combined with *-i*, *-u*, *-U*, *-L* or *-B*. When set most questions are skipped. When
  combined with *-i* an existing configuration will be overwritten with the
  default configuration. When combined  with *-u* or *-U* the check for changed
  configurations is skipped, when combined with *-L* or *-B* editing
  configuration is skipped. 

*-r* 'extension':: 
*--remove* 'extension'::
  Remove an extension. If it is a remote extension the extension will be
  deleted. This option also discards the configuration. 

*-u*::
*--upgrade*::
  Update installed extensions. 

*-U* 'extension'::
*--update* 'extension'::
  Update 'extension', the update will be forced. It is also useful to check if
  the configuration has been changed after using *--upgrade* in combination
  with *--no-confirm*.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*dwbem* expects the environment variables 'EDITOR' and 'DIFF_VIEWER' to be set,
if they are unset 'vim' and 'vimdiff' are used respectively. 'EDITOR' needs to
be set if the configuration is edited or a new extension is installed,
'DIFF_VIEWER' needs to be set if extensions are updated.
