REQUIREMENTS: 

  Runtime libraries: 
   * webkitgtk2 or webkitgtk3 
   * JavaScriptCore 
  
  Buildtime dependencies, libraries including header files:
   * webkitgtk2 or webkitgtk3
   * JavaScriptCore
   * gtk2 or gtk3 
   * gnutls
   * libsoup
   * glib2
   * json-c
  
  Build tools: 
   * gcc or compatible c compiler
   * make
   * m4

INSTALLATION: 

  dwb can be built and installed with 
  
      make install
  
  The default build process will try to link against gtk2, if gtk2 isn't
  installed it will link against gtk3. To force linking against GTK3 run 
      
      make install GTK=3
  
  The default PREFIX is /usr. To choose a different installation location run 
  
      make PREFIX=/path/to/installation install
  
  To install to a different rootdirectory run 
  
      make DESTDIR=/path/to/root install
  
  If the variable BASHCOMPLETION is set, contrib/bash-completion will be
  installed to $(BASHCOMPLETION)/dwb and a symlink to $(BASHCOMPLETION)/dwbem
  will be created.
  
LOCAL BUILD WITHOUT INSTALLATION:
  
  To have a fully functional build without installation some directories must be
  copied or symlinked to $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwb (in most cases ~/.local/share/dwb), 
  namely

      scripts     ->  $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwb/scripts
      html        ->  $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwb/html
      extensions  ->  $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwb/extensions
